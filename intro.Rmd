The Midwater Assessment and Conservation Engineering (MACE) Program of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) conducts annual acoustic-trawl (AT) surveys in the Aleutian Basin near Bogoslof Island (**Honkalehto et al. 2008**) during late winter. The goal of these surveys is to estimate the distribution and abundance of pre-spawning walleye pollock (*Gadus chalcogrammus*; hereafter pollock) at their main spawning grounds (i.e., pre-spawning surveys). The southeastern Aleutian Basin near Bogoslof Island was surveyed annually between 1988 and 2007 (with the exception of 1990 and 2004), and biennially starting in 2009 (with the exception of 2011). The biomass estimate for pollock within the Central Bering Sea (CBS) Convention Specific Area obtained during these AT surveys provides an index of abundance representing 60% of the Aleutian Basin pollock stock[^1]. Therefore, when the pollock biomass estimate from this survey surpasses 1 million metric tons (t), the Aleutian Basin pollock stock surpasses a 1.67 million t threshold above which targeted pollock fishing in the Aleutian Basin can be negotiated. This report summarizes observed pollock distribution and biological information from `r start_date` to `r paste0(end_date, ', ', current_year)`, summarizes water temperature observations and acoustic system calibration results, and provides an abundance estimate used for stock assessment (**Ianelli et al. 2020**).
