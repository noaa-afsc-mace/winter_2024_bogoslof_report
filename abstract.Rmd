Scientists from the Alaska Fisheries Science Center conducted acoustic-trawl surveys in the Gulf of Alaska during late winter `r current_year` to estimate the distribution and abundance of walleye pollock (*Gadus chalcogrammus*) at `r spawning_grounds_statement` These pre-spawning walleye pollock surveys covered the `r shumagins3` `r shelikof_sentence1` (`r as.character(survey_shelikof)`; `r paste0(shel_start_date, "-", shel_end_date )`) `r ifelse(length(unique(current_year_pollock_biomass_nums$region[current_year_pollock_biomass_nums$SURVEY == survey_shelikof])) == 1, 'area', 'areas')`. `r shumagins_survey_sentence` The Shelikof Strait area has been surveyed annually in winter since 1981 (except in `r combine_words(shelikof_missing_years)`).

`r shumagins_bio_num_sentence` `r shelikof_summary_sentence` Walleye pollock between 45 and 64 cm fork length (FL) were primarily composed of the 10-year-old 2012 year class (27% of total biomass). Pollock between 35 and 44 cm FL consisted primarily of 4- and 5-year-old fish from the 2018 and 2017 year classes (20 and 19% of the biomass, respectively). The 17 to 25 cm FL age-2 fish from the 2020 year class were numerically the most abundant (29% of total abundance) but contributed less than 3% to the total biomass. Very few age-1 pollock (<16 cm FL) from the 2021 year class were observed (<2% of total abundance). `r marmot_chirikof_sentences`
